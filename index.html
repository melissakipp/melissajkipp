    <h2>Personal Projects</h2>
    <p>
      As I navigate through the tech industry&comma; I keep in
      mind&period;&period;&period; &quot;Success is a journey not a
      destination&semi; just keep learning and keep growing&quot;&period; As a
      newbie to development with so many directions to go and I am constantly
      running into interesting topics&period; This is just the beginning&period;

      <h3>Humpback Whales</h3>
      <p>
        Tonga is a special place to visit - and if you go at the right time, you
        will be forever changed by seeing these gentle giants swimming with
        babies and engaging in heat runs. The excitement level is high on this
        trip; there’s nothing like hearing the song of a humpback whale as he
        tries to encourage a female to mate with him. Conservation is top
        priority among the locals, who do their best to ensure that the whales
        have a safe place to mate and birth.

      <h3>GB Reef</h3>
      <p>
        Sail to some of the most incredible islands and dive sites in the world.
        The Great Barrier Reef is the world’s largest living organism,
        stretching over 2,000 km down the eastern coast of Australia. This trip
        will allow you to ‘live’ on the reef. We will visit turtle
        conservatories, shark protected breeding grounds, and you’ll learn about
        measures that are being taken to preserve this treasure.

      <h3>Galapagos</h3>
      <p>
        This trip is an amazing opportunity to visit many of the islands in the
        archipelago. There is so much diversity and an abundance of wildlife
        that is found nowhere else on earth. We will spend 10 days with sharks,
        mantas, turtles, ocean iguanas and so much more. Learn about the unique
        conservation efforts and amazing animals found only in the Galapagos.

      <h3>Sharks</h3>
      <p>
        Want to swim with sharks? This trip is for you. We will see tiger
        sharks, hammerheads, lemons and occasionally whale sharks. Not only will
        you have a thrill experiencing silent, graceful beauties swim right by
        you, you will also learn about the importance of sharks. These top-level
        predators are necessary for a healthy ocean and help keep all the other
        species healthy as well.

      <h3>Coral Restoration</h3>
      <p>
        Learn about coral re-growth and restoration. On this trip you will work
        with a team of coral specialists. You’ll see how they grow and care for
        the coral polyps, and once they are large enough, how each one is
        meticulously attached to the reef. You will help our team monitor assess
        the health of corals at various stages of growth and even be able to
        attach new coral to help the reef grow!

      <h3>Maldives</h3>
      <p>
        Our Maldives experience combines adventure with cultural and sustainable
        travel. Our tours allow guests to learn about the Maldives, and its
        culture, beliefs, and traditions through the eyes of a local. You’ll
        stay in an overwater bungalow that overlooks a richly diverse lagoon.
        The island is a safe nesting site for Olive Ridley and Green Sea
        Turtles. You’ll also be able to work with locals, assisting with rescues
        and rehabilitation in this incredible ecosystem.

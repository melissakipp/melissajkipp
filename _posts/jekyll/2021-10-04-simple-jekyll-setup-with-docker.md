As a beginner I was taking several courses on a variety of topics. It seemed
each course wanted to teach you by using different languages and by using
different development approaches for the courseâ€™s example projects. Learning
how to use Docker on a basic level has helped keep less clutter on my computer
and help expand my learning path.

[To learn more about Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/)

**Suggested Learning Course:**

- Udemy - [Docker Mastery: with Kubernetes + Swarm from a Docker Captain](https://www.udemy.com/share/101Wek3@zOLvOQI0uRo0dS7jlYFt3X3gKAqQmMcditgCfJKL3Ccn3jdc3MYD1k_dy-SYOIa0/)

Steps To Creating a Dockerfile for a Jekyll Development Environment 1. Create your project folder.

Step 1: $ mkdir <project-name>

Step 2: $ cd <project-name>

Step 3: Run Docker command `$ docker run --rm -v $(pwd):/site bretfisher/jekyll new .`

- TIP: this must be ran in an empty directory, cannot even have any dockerfile/docker-compose files in the directory

Note:

- This install basic necessities to start a Jekyll site.
- `--rm` flag will remove this container once it is done installing the basic Jekyll files.

Step 4: Make sure you are still in the project folder `$ pwd`

Step 5: `$ touch docker-compose.yml`

Step 6: `$ vi docker-compose.yml`

```yaml
version: "2.7"

services:
  jekyll:
    image: bretfisher/jekyll-serve
    volumes:
      - .:/site
    ports:
      - "8080:4000"
```

Step 7: `$ sudo chmod -R 777 .`

Step 8: `$ docker-compose up -d`
_NOTE: I add -d flag so that it runs detach._

**Extra Docker Daily commands (make sure you are in the project folder):**

- `$ docker-compose stop`
- `$ docker-compose start`
- `$ docker-compose restart` Mostly use this command when making changes to \_config.yml
- Once the project is completed `$ docker-compose down -v --rmi all`

**Tip: \_config.yml**

```yaml
exclude:
  - .sass-cache/
  - .jekyll-cache/
  - gemfiles/
  - Gemfile
  - Gemfile.lock
  - node_modules/
  - vendor/bundle/
  - vendor/cache/
  - vendor/gems/
  - vendor/ruby/
  - docker-compose.yml
```

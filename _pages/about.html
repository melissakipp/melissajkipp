      <h2>Frontend Developer</h2>
      <p>
        I'm a curious developer, aspiring designer and an accessibility
        enthusiast.

      Previously, I was in the childcare industry. Even though, I loved working
      with children for the past 15 years it was time for a career change. After
      leaving, I started researching other possible career choices. I quickly
      became fascinated with graphic design and the complexity of the subject.
      This eventually led me to web design, which then led me down the rabbit
      hole of the ever-changing coding world.

      My career goal is to be an accomplished multidisciplined individual. As I
      grow my knowledge in coding, I also strive to keep up with design
      information and techniques.

      Since beginning my journey I have envisioned joining a team that share
      similar goals as I do. Even though I am familiar with using frameworks, my
      current practice is to primarily hand-code all my projects. The areas I
      would like to continue my focus on is using HTML, CSS and VueJS/ReactJS,
      while also having opportunities to work on building my Vanilla JavaScript
      skills.

    I'm a curious developer, aspiring designer and an accessibility enthusiast.
  </p>

  <p>
    Previously, I was in the childcare industry. Even though, I loved working
    with children for the past 15 years it was time for a career change. After
    leaving, I started researching other possible career choices. I quickly
    became fascinated with graphic design and the complexity of the subject.
    This eventually led me to web design, which then led me down the rabbit hole
    of the ever-changing coding world.

  <p>
    My future career goal is to be an accomplished multidisciplined individual.
    As I grow my knowledge in coding, I also strive to keep up with design
    information.
  </p>
  <p>
    Since beginning my journey I have envisioned joining a team that share
    similar goals as I do. Even though I am familiar with using frameworks, my
    current practice is to primarily hand-code all my projects. The areas I
    would like to continue focus on is using HTML, CSS and VueJS/ReactJS, while
    also having opportunities to work on building my Vanilla JavaScript skills.

    I'm a curious developer, aspiring designer and an accessibility enthusiast.
  </p>

  <p>
    Previously, I was in the childcare industry. Even though, I have loved
    working with children for the past 15 years, it was time to take a break.
    After leaving, I started researching other possible career choices. I
    quickly became fascinated with graphic design and the complexity of the
    subject. Eventually, I found my way to web design, which led me down the
    rabbit hole of the coding world.
  </p>
  <p>
    My future career goals is to be a multidisciplined individual. As I work to
    get better at coding, I also strive to keep up with design information.
  </p>
  <p>
    Since beginning my journey I have look forward to joining a team that shares
    similar goals as I do. Even though I am familiar with using frameworks my
    current practice is to primarily hand-code my projects. The areas I would
    like to focus on is using HTML, CSS and VueJS/ReactJS, while also having
    opportunities to work on building my Vanilla JavaScript skills.
